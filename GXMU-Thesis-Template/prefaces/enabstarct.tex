Several approaches have been proposed for estimating the glass transition temperature of mixtures and random copolymers from knowledge of the properties of the pure components. Although different in detail, the proposed relationships are all based on the additivity of basic thermophysical properties. One of the most popular equations for predicting glass transition temperatures of amorphous mixtures and random copolymers is the Gordon-Taylor equation:\\[.5em]
